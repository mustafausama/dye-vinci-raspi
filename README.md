# Dye-Vinci Controller

Our semester's capstone challenge was the cost in the industry. This project was implemented in an automation system to connect factory machines to controller devices to control the machines.
It was tested by using Raspberry Pi and Arduino. WebSocket was implemented to carry orders and data between machines and controllers. NodeJS was used on both the machines and controllers to listen to and emit events.
